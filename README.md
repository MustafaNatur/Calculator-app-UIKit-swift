### How it works:
- Open the app and spot any GO bike on the map.
- Scan the code on that bike to unlock the bike. 
- Take the bike anywhere, anytime.
- Now that when you have reached your destination, just open the app, click the photo of the odometer and end your trip parking the bike at any location.

### Why you will love it:
- Pick anywhere and drop anywhere
- Cheaper than a cab, auto, and even bus.
- Faster than any other transportation medium
- Your ride is just a QR code scan away
